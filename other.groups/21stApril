Minutes for 21/4/98 1500hrs written by Maynard (mc)

Everyone was present.

Need to sort out a group representative. mc is volunteering if no-one has
any violent objections.

Good idea to look at Pert & Gant (spelling?!) charts. David could have a
go at doing some on Microsoft Project (availiable on PCs in 1508) when we
get a better specification and a set of milestones. Tim recommended we
work back from the last Wednesday whe
n planning.

Tim also recommended thinking about possible risks.

Market research - do some now, some after spec has been handed in. (The
later market research can only be put in the feasibility study.) Ask
small companies how much people would pay, check out the competition
(both commercial and fellow groups).

Tim (essentially) said we could be more ambitious as far as the design is
concerned. We need to think about potential features - a brainstorm
session is planned for tomorrow (Wed 22nd) morning.

Discussed different card entry technologies. Need to look at catalogues
for potential solutions (barcodes, magnetic strip, physical keys etc).

Things to do:
Read documentation.
Think of wild, zany ideas that could outclass other groups.
