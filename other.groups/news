	The file SL-MarketResearch.mail contains a copy of the reply I got back
from a person I know quite well at Scottish Life (medium-sized insurance 
company in Edinburgh). I worked there last summer & Easter, and they seem quite
willing to help out. They haven't given an 'official' response yet, but they
do point out some things we may wish to think about.
	Anyway, I'll stop ramblimg - just have a look.

	The other thing is my Electrical Lectures, just so you all know when
I'm NOT able to be about. They are :
	Monday 2PM - 5PM.
	Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday @ 12PM.

There is new mail to read. Dont't use pine to read it, since it will mark
it as read, and other members would not be able to read it.

A few (very) minor points:
1: I have the key to the cupboard.
2: Do not, under any circumstances, tell anyone about the features of our
design. Although the specs have to be handed in today, other groups could
add our features to their designs after handing in the spec.

I reckon the priority for today is to get a preliminary spec sorted out
before we go and see Tim. Might be worth seeing if we can find a room to
thrash out the details.

program the 68040 board. it is at: www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/cs3design/gcc.pdf

Added in a brainstorming file containing all ideas. Read and have a think
- see which are good ideas and which aren't.

As pointed out by Rafal, the checklist mechanism is not for acknowledging
reading the newsgroup.  It is for matters that need to be circulated
among us and we need to make sure everybody has read and/or answered
them.  And as I forgot to include it earlier:

If you have any comments whatsoever, please tell them.

The individual check file is now ready as well.  The template file is
there to be used whenever there is something new that needs to be
circulated.  It's readable only in order not to overwrite it by mistake.
Read it in, add the subject body, tick yourse
lf off, save it with a meaningful name and put up a message in the news
file.  As a start, I will make a file for everybody to acknowledge being
happy with this system (including the news file and the minutes
directory).  I will call it Comm_Organisation.

I've done the minutes & created this file. Also if you run Netscape from
this login, you'll find a few bookmarks about door entry systems (but not
very interesting ones.)
