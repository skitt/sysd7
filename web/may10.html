SOFTWARE<DT>
The video is finished. The serial works and is hopefully fine in both directions. The only remaining problem is the audio, the sound is getting through but is ending up distorted and cackling. From the PC to the morotorola a voice is some times audible; in the other direction you tend to get an alarm sound.

We have put more people onto audio in the hope of getting a fresh look at it. It is unlikely to be a hardware problem as this has all being tested. They will book consultation time if they are still having problems with it tomorrow.

The GUI is virtually done, the database is nearly in operation, and they are just working on connecting the buttons to door. They are working on the essential features.
