<DT>REPORTS
<DT>SC- Investigated Dallas rings, smart cards and swipe cards. Dallas rings 
cost £2 each, cheaper when bought in bulk. The reader is £5. The smart 
card is not a good option as there is no supplier of blank cards, finding
information on the cards also proved difficult. Swipe cards only cost £25 
for the reader but do wipe themselves after a short while. He has sent away 
for more data about the rings and the swipe cards.

<DT>The principal problem with the rings are that the readers are not vandal proof.
<DT>The problem with the swipe cards are that the programmer is too expensive.

<DT>IC- Looked at the bar-codes, the pros are it would be impressive, 
conviniant and  cheap. The downside is that we would be unable to test it
until near the end of the project.

<DT>SK- Tried to get the quick-cam up and running. Has also come to the conclusiona packet approach for data would be our best option.

<DT>SCX,JN- Have read the manuals for the hardware, looked at the chips and havebooked consultation time to go over their work. Hardware is harder than
first thought.

<DT>EK- Has checked on the sound, everything will work fine with linux.

<DT>IT- Has continued with the documentation.

<DT>DI- Has investigated the video, estimates we might only get 1 frame per secondfrom the cameras.

<DT>DECISIONS
<DT>We will use Dallas Rings
<DT>Our Target market is public property requiring a level of security eg schools.

<DT>PLAN
<DT>IT- Work on the requirement spec for 12pm April 23.
<DT>Hardware- Speak to Tim Hopkins
<DT>IC- i/o programming
<DT>SK- video compression and write tests for camera and serial connections.
<DT>Software- meeting at 10am.
<DT>EK,SC- Time sheets
