HARDWARE<DT>
<P>
The hardware is finished, it is only in need of minor corrections. They have 
purchased a lock, latch and wood to make a door for the presentation. They 
will start work on the hardware manual and put their input into the 
feasibility study. 
<P>
SOFTWARE<DT>
The video software is essentially finished. We have had the code working 
correctly from the Motorola to the PC. The database is virtually done you can 
place a ring in the holder and it will read the correct code.
They are still having problems with the  audio, but they have rewritten some 
of the serial code. They hope to have at least the audio going from the PC to 
the Motorola over the weekend  
<P>
DOCUMENTATION<DT>
Finished working on the feasibility study and the management document. Both
have been given out to two members of the group to proof check it. 

<P>
MARKETING
We have now decided to make decisions about the presentations. We will 
allocate people to each depending on their desire to do it and their 
technical or marketing skills. We will use slides in the afternoon, 
as this will help us make our point clearly and effeciantly. We will also be 
filming a short video to make fun of the other products. 

PLAN<P>
The documentation will be corrected over the weekend. The video will be filmed
on Sunday and edited on Tuesday. The audio will be completed over the weekend.
We don't plan to make any more drastic changes to the product over the next
week but to consolidate our position.
