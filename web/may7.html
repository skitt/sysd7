HARDWARE<DT>
<P>
Everything has been built and wired, everything has been individually tested. 
They need to test and run the system as one unit but are hopeful of meeting our
self imposed Friday deadline. In case anything goes wrong we have copies of 
all the chips and will be able to replace any broken part. 
One slight problem in that video interferes with serial and vice versa, but
this is being examined.
<P>
SOFTWARE<DT>
 The database has been tested on the Motorola and seems to be working correctly
The testing will continue for the rest of the day. When we get more Dallas
rings then we will be able to use correct values. The GUI is still in 
development but shouldn't prove a problem if everything else is up and 
running. The serial is correct in one direction and work has started on the
other way. Video has been tested with the serial and is proving slightly
buggy. The first image transmitted is correct the rest are corrupted. The 
audio standard has been changed from ADPCM to a more simpler method. This
comes about as ADPCM was proving to be to hardware intensive for our
hardware.

<P>
DOCUMENTATION<DT>
Worked on 3d packages for the presentation, conclusion is that 3d studio max will have to be used. Has finished the management report up until present.

<P>
PLAN<DT>
The hardware team will be splitting up into marketing and documentation, one
of them well liase with the software team to explain any design points. 
Everyone is confident of meeting their individual deadlines for this Friday.
