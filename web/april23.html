<DT>REPORTS
<P>
<DT>MARKET - Our market research suggests that schools should be our target market. In light of the Cullen inquiry the security should be should be good enough to allay parents worries but not be to restrictive to an environment that should be welcoming. 
<P>
<DT>The system  will be tailored towards their needs and will be configurable. Different schools will have competing needs.
<P>
<DT>Our research also indicates a market with the NHS; especially maternity wards which increasingly need a low level of security and identification. The advantage of the Dallas ring over swipe cards is that they will not be wiped in a highly magnetized environment.
<P>
<DT> SOFTWARE - They are  considering the software requirements. The  software will be split into modules and consideration will have to be given about how the two main areas will connect. The software team split up to investigate separate issues but they hope to have something by Tuesday.
<P>
<DT> They have also considered the features they wish to include (see Design Spec of April 23rd)
<P>
<DT> HARDWARE - Have looked at the capabilities of the chips and have started
timing diagrams. Generally their opinion is that once they have the design 
they should have no problem with the construction.
<P>
<DT> They aim is to have the hardware up and running by the start of the third week and should consider ordering some of the chips immediately.
<P>
<DT> DOCUMENTATION - To have the design spec ready for 4.30 on April 23. Also to have the document checked by Stuart Anderson as soon as possible. 
<P>
<DT> DECISIONS
