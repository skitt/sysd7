HARDWARE<DT>
The hardware is theoretically correct. They have checked it with Tim and now 
hope to start building it. The construction will take place in stages and they
will need to test some chips.<P>

<P>
SOFTWARE<DT>
See the state diagram and the previous minutes.(their report is the same)<DT>
They have allocated 2-3 days next week for integration.  Each state has now 
been documented by each individual, and the document is been produced. 
GB wants us to write about the functionality rather documenting all the code.
<P>
Their only worries are with the Audio implementation. It is not known how the 
motorola will cope with the code. Last years groups had a lot of trouble 
porting their code over. 
<P>
DOCUMENTATION<DT>
The Feasibility study is still on going.
