HARDWARE<DT>
Is looking good.  Everything has been tested and it is just a matter of 
putting it all together. They have built everything apart from the audio 
compression.

<P>
SOFTWARE<DT>
Video is as far on as it can get without the serial being implemented. The 
video may take up to a day to test once the serial is complete.<DT>

The serial is continuing. Work is nearly complete on the Linux side, and it
is theoretically correct on the Motorola side.<DT>

They are integrating the video with the GUI.<DT>

They have an audio compression program, that is being read through and
optimized.<P>

DOCUMENTS<DT>
Surprised at the level of detail. But praised the hand in and stated that he 
had confidence in our design. Minor points were that figures did not always
relate to diagrams; and detail was sketchier in some place than others. It 
should be made clearer that the mechanical lock is a feature of the door and
not the unit. State more clearly, how refuse entry works.<P>

DOCUMENTATION<DT>
The Feasibility study is still on going. It is now at a point were it
should be handed over to somebody else to gain  a different outlook.
Progress should know be made on the presentation and the market research.
<P>
PLAN<DT>
IC will help SK<DT>
IT to start on presentation.<DT>
Towards the end of the week the hardware team will split up into software and
documentation.<DT>
