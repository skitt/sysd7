MINUTES<DT> 
Passed and accepted as a true record of the previous meeting. 
<P>
HARDWARE<DT>
They have ordered and received some of the parts, but they will need to get a 
few others. They are nearly ready to start construction; Tim Hopkins has 
checked their design and seems to have no problem with it. They have 
started some rudimentary testing. For the Feasibility study it should be noted that two of the chips we are using are obsolete.  
<P>
SOFTWARE<DT>
There is a snag with the interface, we may not be able to get audio + video 
together. The camera will record pictures until the buzzer sounds and then 
only audio will be active. The user could then check the previous video frames for a clear picture.
<P>
We should aim to have the simpler design running before we expand it. It is noted that this design does not meet our minimum spec.
<P>
The video compression could run at one frame per second. Once all the hardware is finished we we will be able to test the client side software. The audio has has a choice of two different standards one of which is to hardware intensive
to proceed  with.
  

<P>
DOCUMENTATION<DT>
Has made contacted with our target groups to gauge a response to our system.
Continues to work on the Feasibility study. Should contact the Royal 
Infirmary or the Scottish Schools Research Center. A phone can be obtained 
from Bill Orakks office.
