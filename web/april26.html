MINUTES<DT> 
Passed and accepted as a true record of the previous meeting.

HARDWARE<DT>
They looked into buying the hardware design. This is not possible; but you can 
get a good idea on how to go about it by using up consultation time. They 
hope to start construction by the end of the week and have something working 
for Monday.<DT>
 
They will order some of the hardware today.

SOFTWARE<DT>
The video is almost complete but it needs to run faster. They consider 
progress to be good. The Audio specs have now being decided and they are 
investigating the interface to see how it will multi-task. THere is an of using 
the SSCOP code for the serial link but GB thinks we can do it more simply 
than this.
