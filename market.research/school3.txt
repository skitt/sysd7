Union calls for single entrances

EVERY school in Britain should be redesigned so that they have only one 
entrance, teachers' unions said yesterday.

Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters 
and Union of Women Teachers, said yesterday that the measure might take years 
but was needed to reassure parents that schools were as safe as possible. Mr de 
Gruchy called for the group on school security, set up after the fatal stabbing 
of the head teacher Philip Lawrence last December, to be reconvened urgently to 
consider the move.

He said: "I think the group needs to make a firm decision in principle to go 
for perimeter fencing to establish the boundaries of every school. I know it 
will take time, but if there is only one entrance it can be better monitored."

The National Union of Teachers backed the move, which was first recommended by 
Lord Elton in his 1989 inquiry into school security.

The issue of school security was already set to dominate the union conferences 
this Easter, before the Dunblane massacre.

At the conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, the first of 
the season, the union's Manchester branch will call for "legislation which will 
ensure that each school invests in adequate and appropriate safety and 
surveillance systems to protect staff and deter intruders".


John Young, head teacher of Sullivan Upper School in Holywood, Co Down, where 
two years ago an intruder turned a flamethrower on students sitting exams, said 
every school should now have a disaster plan.

Mr Young wrote yesterday to the head teacher of Dunblane Primary School to 
offer his support.
