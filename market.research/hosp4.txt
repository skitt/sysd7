Hospital reviews use of tagging

MANAGERS at Basildon Hospital are reviewing whether they should issue new-born 
babies with electronic security tags after the abduction of Karli Hawthorne.

In the past, nursing staff and doctors had preferred to rely on the vigilance 
of staff.

A 33-year-old woman with three children is to appear before magistrates today 
charged with abduction. Denise Giddings, from Langdon Hills, Basildon, remains 
in custody after being charged at 6pm on Saturday.

Karli and her mother, Tanya Hawthorne, 30, stayed at the hospital yesterday and 
are likely to be discharged later this week.

Mrs Hawthorne, recalling the moment of the abduction, told the Daily Mirror : 
"I heard a woman opposite me on the ward say`She's picked up her baby. Is she 
allowed to do that?'

"A nurse rushed in, saw the empty cot and said`The baby, she's gone!' I 
said`Gone where?' I didn't know what she was going on about. I knew in my heart 
that whoever had taken my baby would look after her well. I didn't feel angry 
with her, I just felt deeply sorry for her."
