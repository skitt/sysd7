Security measures fall short, say teachers

Tuesday, 9 July 1996     David Charter, Education Correspondent

 

TEACHERS' leaders said last night that measures to tighten school security 
after the killing of Philip Lawrence had not gone far enough.

A working party of civil servants, teachers, parents and governors, set up 
after the London head teacher had been stabbed in December, made 22 
recommendations on school safety.

Despite the Government's pledge that schools would be able to bid for 
"substantial" new money to fortify premises, ministers have yet to state how 
much will be available. Police powers have already been extended in line with 
the group's recommendations to include searching school premises without 
permission from the head. Other proposals accepted by the Government include 
better personal defence training for teachers.

But Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of 
Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, said that resources were needed to 
back up the words. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said school 
security ought not to be based on a competition for money.
