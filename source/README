The directory structure for software is as follows:

/software
  /states       - State transition glue code
    /linux
    /motorola
  /audio	- Audio codec
    /linux
    /motorola
  /video	- Video codec
    /linux
    /motorola
  /control	- Control software
    /linux
    /motorola
  /lib		- Code libraries
    /linux
    /motorola
  /transport	- Data transport between Linux and Motorola
    /linux
    /motorola
  /low.level	- Any low level code
    /linux
    /motolola
  /design       - Design Documents
  /testing	- General testing code
  /support      - Support Routines

Portable code should go into the base directory, with Linux- or
Motorola-specific code in the appropriate subdirectory.

To generate the appropriate Makefile, copy either
/software/Makefile.motorola or ...linux to Makefile and edit it to
suit. There should be no Makefiles in the base directories, only in
the target-specific directories; the latter should refer to any files
in their parent directories.

You can check for the definition of SDPLinux or SDPMotorola in your
source files to determine the target.
