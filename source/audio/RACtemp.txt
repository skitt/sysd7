Dear Sirs,
         I apologise for the tardiness of my final declaration, however I have
had a major deadline at work and have been working all the hours that God sends
in order to meet it.  I enclose the remittance for 11 competitors : £28.49, as well as the Steward's Report.

Yours faithfully,





Duncan Irvine
