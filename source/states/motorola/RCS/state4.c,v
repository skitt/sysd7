@I have altered the state so that it behaves as normal rather than returning
10 straight away.  This may go some way to curing the problems Ed & I were
having earlier this evening whilst trying to integrate the GUI & audio on
the PC.  It only struck me that I was talking bollocks when I started
writing the documentation for it.  Maybe documentation does have its uses
after all....
