REPORTS
MARKET - Our market research has led us to the conclusion that schools should
be our target. They need a certain level of security in light of the
cullen inquiry, whilst still having a  welcoming environment.

We will need a system that will be tailored towards their needs, and that will
be configurable. Different schools will have competing needs.

A similar system is the nursery cam that allows parents to view what their 
children are up to from the Internet.

Our clients could also include the NHS, maternity wards also require a certain
level of security. The advantage of the Dallas ring over swipe cards is that 
they will not be wiped in a highly magnetized environment.

SOFTWARE - Is considering the software requirement. The  software will be
split into modules and consideration will have to be given about how the two
main areas will connect. The software team have split up to investigate
separate issues but they hope to have something by Tuesday.

They have also considered the features they wish to include(see Design Spec 
of April 23rd)

HARDWARE - Have looked at the capabilities of the chips and have started
timing diagrams. Generally there opinion is that once they have the design 
they should have no problem with the construction.

They should aim to have the hardware up and running by the start of the third 
week and should consider ordering some of the chips immediately.

DOCUMENTATION- To have the design spec ready for 4.30 on April 23. Also to
have the document checked by Stuart Anderson as soon as possible. 

DECISIONS
Need to have a deadline for the hardware group. Therefore they should 
investigate buying the design.

PLAN
See Time Diagram for an approximate plan for the next four weeks.
