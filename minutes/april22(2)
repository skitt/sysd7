REPORTS
SC- Investigated Dallas rings, smart cards and swipe cards. Dallas rings 
cost £2 each, cheaper when bought in bulk. The reader is £5. The smart 
card is not a good option as there is no supplier of blank cards, finding
information on the cards also proved difficult. Swipe cards only cost £25 
for the reader but do wipe themselves after a short while. He has sent away 
for more data about the rings and the swipe cards.

The principal problem with the rings are that the readers are not vandal proof.
The problem with the swipe cards are that the programmer is too expensive.

IC- Looked at the bar-codes, the pros are it would be impressive, 
conviniant and  cheap. The downside is that we would be unable to test it
until near the end of the project.

SK- Tried to get the quick-cam up and running. Has also come to the conclusion
a packet approach for data would be our best option.

SCX,JN- Have read the manuals for the hardware, looked at the chips and have
booked consultation time to go over their work. Hardware is harder than
first thought.

EK- Has checked on the sound, everything will work fine with linux.

IT- Has continued with the documentation.

DI- Has investigated the video, estimates we might only get 1 frame per second
from the cameras.
