1 Introduction

Ding Dong Doorentry Systems Ltd. (DDDS) has commissioned our group
to develop an idea for a new product. Their existing product market
is centred on low-technology but robust door entry systems for stair
doors. They would like to move into production of high specification
door entry systems and, in particular, see a potential market that
takes advantage of the fact that most small companies and many households
now own a personal computer. The concept that DDDS has proposed is
to use the screen and sound facilities already present on PC's, in
combination with a remote door control unit. The intention is to sell
a door entry system that allows a person within the premises to use
a PC to view and communicate with the person at the door. In addition,
the fact that all PC's are supplied with serial ports allows the PC
to provide these functions whilst being situated away from the door
itself. The remote door control unit would be sold together with the
necessary PC software. 

As a further development of the concept, DDDS have proposed having
automated entry control, such that entry can be gained without an
operator being present at the PC. They have suggested that this could
be done by operating the door with a combination of some kind of personal
card or key, and a PIN number.

We have been commissioned to produce a demonstration prototype of this
product. In doing this, we have refined the initial specification
for the product, and decided on the best way to provide the facilities
that DDDS wants to see. This report outlines the findings of our market
research, the design decisions which we have taken, and identifies
the additional features that could increase the product's marketability. 

2 Market Research

The given design specification identified two categories for the product,
namely the commercial and the residential markets. We carried out
a survey to gauge the degree of practicality and interest in producing
a product for these markets. Both surveys involved asking three questions:

1. Do you have a PC in your household/business?

2. If you do, do you have some sort of door entry system?

3. If so, would you be interested in a combined system? 

2.1 Residential Properties

We carried out an informal survey of one hundred and twenty seven residents
in and around Marchmont. The accommodation in this area mostly comprises
of flats with communal stairwells; this market is already served by
DDDS's existing products and those of its competitors.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                     Residential Survey Results                       | YES | NO |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                 Do you have a PC in your Household?                  | 42  | 85 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|             Do you have some form of door entry system?              | 35  | 7  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|Would you be interested in combining the PC with a door entry system? |  6  | 29 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+


Our survey indicates that only 17% of the people who had a PC and a
door entry system would be interested in a product that combined the
two. Although the market demand is currently low, it is possible that
the demand in future might be greater. We identified the main residential
markets to assess their likely future demands.

2.1.1 Blocks of Flats 

\includegraphics{../web/images/pw3375.ps} 

The increase of PC's in the home may allow this product to become an
alternative to the standard door entry system. According to a representative
of Castle Security (a local security company) the system would face
the problem of convincing sections of the population of its value.
There will always be a percentage who will be resistant to new technology.
Another major weak point of a system in this market is that the fundamental
design requires the PC to be switched on during all of the day. With
current technology, this would be expensive and impractical. In addition,
it is questionable whether the PC would be situated in a convenient
location for this task; if not, the system would require extra cables
to be run to the PC which would increase the cost of the system and
the inconvenience for the householder.

2.1.2 Accommodation with a servitor

\resizebox*{6cm}{!}{\includegraphics{../web/images/masson.ps}} 

This form of accommodation differs from the above in that there is
usually some form of supervision at the point of entry, i.e. a servitor.
The servitor's office would contain the PC and during the day people
could be let in by visual identification only. During the night a
form of security could be set for the main entrances. The potential
market here is accommodation similar to halls of residence. 

A spokesman for Pollock Halls of Residence was enthusiastic about the
proposed system; the individual halls all have offices next to the
main entrance, and all the offices also contain PC's that are unused
overnight. The system could be useful in restricting access to residents
only after a preset time. The spokesman also suggested a possible
application of the product for the main gate of the halls; this would
involve some form of access control for vehicles. This system could
allow multiple sites to be administered from a central security office,
thus reducing the costs of security provision.

2.1.3 Semi / Detached Property

1 Introduction

Ding Dong Doorentry Systems Ltd. (DDDS) has commissioned our group
to develop an idea for a new product. Their existing product market
is centred on low-technology but robust door entry systems for stair
doors. They would like to move into production of high specification
door entry systems and, in particular, see a potential market that

operator being present at the PC. They have suggested that this could
be done by operating the door with a combination of some kind of personal
card or key, and a PIN number.

We have been commissioned to produce a demonstration prototype of this

that DDDS wants to see. This report outlines the findings of our market
research, the design decisions which we have taken, and identifies
the additional features that could increase the product's marketability. 

2 Market Research

The given design specification identified two categories for the product,
namely the commercial and the residential markets. We carried out
a survey to gauge the degree of practicality and interest in producing
a product for these markets. Both surveys involved asking three questions:

1. Do you have a PC in your household/business?

2. If you do, do you have some sort of door entry system?

3. If so, would you be interested in a combined system? 

2.1 Residential Properties

We carried out an informal survey of one hundred and twenty seven residents
in and around Marchmont. The accommodation in this area mostly comprises
of flats with communal stairwells; this market is already served by
DDDS's existing products and those of its competitors.

Typically these properties do not have a remote door entry system such
as an intercom. A major reason for this is that existing security
measures, such as mechanical locks and door peep-holes, are far cheaper
and more reliable. Systems such as intercoms tend to be used where
the distance from the door to the operator is significant, but in
this sort of residential property, a visitor can expect to be met
at the front door. Therefore, the market in this sector is extremely
limited. 

A more likely market in this area would be properties sited within
large grounds, which can have entrances that are set a significant
distance away from the property. These properties could use the improved
security of visual communication, and the added convenience of being
able to identify visitors from inside the property. However, there
is once again a number of drawbacks of the proposed system. Primarily,
the use of a PC as the control device conflicts with typical patterns
of PC use in a domestic environment, namely that it would need to
be powered up for most of the time. It would also need to be in an
easily accessed location, such as a hallway, and would therefore need
to be as small and discrete as possible. Existing intercom and videophone
solutions have recognised this, and have produced products no bigger
than a conventional telephone. 

2.2 Conclusion

In the residential market sector, it is clear that the proposed system
has a number of significant drawbacks. Existing products provide both
audio and video functionality, and at a moderate cost. The lack of
uniformity of PC ownership means that such a system is an immediate
non-starter in shared stair environments. Furthermore, the cost of
providing a PC as part of the package would negate any potential cost
saving inherent in the system concept. What the domestic residential
market really wants is reliable, low cost technology that is easy
to use, convenient and discrete. On these grounds, the proposed system
would be unable to compete with products already on the market. Our
research findings backs this up; the majority of people are quite
happy with their present system.

2.3 Commercial

2.3.1 Small/Large Business

We carried out an informal survey of fourteen small to medium size
commercial properties.. They comprised of an architects office to
a dental surgery.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                             Commercial                               | YES | NO |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                   Does your office contain a PC?                     | 15  | 0  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|             Do you have some form of door entry system?              | 14  | 1  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|Would you be interested in combining the PC with a door entry system? |  8  | 6  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+


Our survey indicates that 57% of the companies who had a PC and a door
entry system would be interested in a product that combined the two.
Specific commercial targets were then identified so that we could
determine a business strategy.

2.3.2 Education

We carried out an informal survey of seven local schools. Three of
which are primary schools and four are secondary.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                              Education                               | YES | NO |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                   Does your school contain a PC?                     |  7  |    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|             Do you have some form of door entry system?              |     | 7  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|Would you be interested in combining the PC with a door entry system? |     |    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+


Enabling schools to place this system at the entrances would allow
them to control access. Allowing the children and the teachers to
have their own entry device would allow them to have authorized access
to the school. Anyone else would be required to identify themselves
using the audio/visual communication. Outside of school times the
site would be closed to all but those with security access.

2.3.3 NHS 

The system would be integrated to the front doors of wards that could
benefit from having some form of security eg. maternity wards. Visitors
would only be able to enter these areas if they had a specific reason
to be there. The problem with existing NHS security include

* security being lax because no-one monitors the video cameras.

* security is bypassed by people who pretend to be someone else

The system would have to be reliable and easy to use as there may be
emergency situations when time is critical; specifically a cardiac
arrest alert needs a doctor to get to the patient as soon a possible.

2.4 Conclusion

Examining the commercial user group, their needs and their response
to our proposed design it is clear that there is enthusiasm from the
majority of this market. Our decision will be whether to design the
product for a general commercial group or whether we should concentrate
on a specific market.

3 Market Decision

Three points influenced our decision to aim the product at a specific
niche market.

3.1 Government Legislation 

In the wake of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma
City, the Justice Department reviewed security at federal facilities
around the country. The review resulted in some 8,500 countermeasures
now being implemented by the General Services Administration (GSA).
A significant number of which concern visitor access to buildings.

3.2 School Security

It is clear from our own survey that schools have little or no security.
In light of the Cullen Inquiry into the Dunblane shooting Lord Cullen
stated

``It is recognized that there should be arrangements for security to
prevent unauthorized access to the school.''

The national union of teachers stated that 

``Every school in Britain should be redesigned so that they have only
one entrance.'' 

Which was first recommended by Lord Elton in his 1989 inquiry into
school security. The Manchester branch of the NUT called for 

``Legislation which will ensure that each school invests in adequate
and appropriate safety and surveillance systems to protect staff and
deter intruders.''

3.2.1 Case Study

``Several schools have suffered devastating arson attacks. Millions
have had to be spent on refurbishment or rebuilding, simply because
arsonists could walk on to school premises at will.

Then there is theft. It is quite common for thieves to wander into
school in search of easy pickings during the working day. One school
had people and property protected by a security guard with an Alsatian
during parents' evenings.

The tragic deaths of Philip Lawrence, the head teacher who died protecting
a pupil, and of Nicky Conroy, the schoolgirl shot dead while quietly
at work in a school classroom, should have focused attention on the
problem of how to keep undesirables away from schools. 

One week prior to the government report into school security, the deranged
Thomas Hamilton ran amok and killed 16 infants and a teacher at Dunblane
in March 1996.''

The Times (Friday, 24 May 1996)

3.2.2 Interview with Mr N McLeod (Assistant Head Teacher of Stornoway Primary
  School)

Stornoway Primary has a roll of approximately 420 pupils. All the classes
are held in one complex, and the site is self contained. There are
seven entrances. One for each year of the school, and two main entrances
for visitors and teachers etc.

Are there any problem with security at the school?

``The main problem we have is the rise of vandalism at the weekends,
school windows broken and dustbins being set alight. Vandalism costs
the school approximately £10,000 per year''

What measures does the school have in tackling security issues?

``During the day the school is open to anyone; at night the entrances
are all locked and the police make regular patrols to discourage the
vandals. By the autumn the school will be connected up to Stornoway's
CCTV system.''

Does the school have a budget for security?

``No, we just use our budget to pay for any security measures. In the
past this has meant buying better security for the windows on the
ground floor.''

Is there more pressure on schools in light of the Dunblane report?

``In the immediate aftermath, there was a degree of anxiety from parents,
I think it has made them more aware that schools can find it hard
to properly look after every individual pupil.''

3.2.3 Interview with Angus Morrison of the SSERC

The SSERC (Scottish Schools Equipment Research Center) are a service
set up in 1965 by the Scottish Education Authorities as a common agency
to provide advice, information, consultancy and training on science
and technology education equipment and facilities. 

Up to the 1996 reorganization of Scottish Local Government the members
of the company were the twelve regional and islands councils. At this
moment in time members are being recruited from the thirty two new
unitary councils. Members pay an annual subscription plus fees in
return for specific services. Members and third parties may also access
other aspects of the service such as training and consultancy at additional
charge. Membership of the company carries the right to nominate a
director to the Board of the company. It is this Board which has overall
control of SSERC science, technology and safety support services. 

The service employs staff and engages part-time consultants with relevant
specialist scientific and technological qualifications and expertise.
Most of the team are also qualified teachers or support staff and
between them have many years of practical, educational experience. 

What is your role in the SSERC?

``I teach Chemistry at Rutherglen Academy, and I carry out consultation
work in project management for the SSERC.''

Can you see a need for increased school security?

``I think there is a need for your system in some areas of the country;
but there needs to be a balance struck between bringing up children
in a safe environment and bringing them up over protected.''

What do you consider to be the good points about our system?

``If it is cheap and reliable then that will be a strong selling point.
In school situations it is also advantageous if it can be user-friendly
and safe.''

What would you be looking for in a security system?

``How does the system react if there is a fire alarm? How do you know
when the system has stopped working? Can a pupil turn up late and
use the excuse that their Dallas ring failed to open the door? Does
each door in the site have the system, and if they do, do they all
come with video cameras and are they all connected to the one PC?
Most importantly, will this system still work for you in ten years;
in twenty years?''

3.3 Hospital Wards

There have been many incidents of security problems in hospitals. Babies
have been snatched and bogus doctors have been allowed to enter wards
and carry out injections to patients.

3.3.1 Case Study

Over recent years a number of baby's have been snatched from hospitals

``A baby girl was snatched from her cot in a hospital maternity unit
yesterday three hours after being born, in front of her drowsing mother
who lay in an adjacent bed recovering from a Caesarian section.

Kali Hawthorne was grabbed by a blonde-haired woman who walked into
the ward as the baby's father was telephoning relatives from a nearby
corridor to tell them of the birth ... The abduction again raised
major questions about security in hospital maternity wards which was
supposed to have been increased following the abduction of four-hour-old
Abbie Humphreys from the Queen's Medical Center, Nottingham, in July
1994.'' 

The Daily Telegraph (6th Decembers 1997)

A bogus doctor treated patients due to the open access of hospital
wards.

``A bogus doctor who apparently staged a re-enactment of a plot from
the medical television series Dangerfield was being sought by police
last night. 

The incident, on Tuesday in Bysing Wood, near Faversham, Kent, mirrors
the plot of the Oct 25 episode of the BBC series. The women walked
into a geriatric ward, posing as a doctor from a local health center
and injected her "patient" in both arms. It is not known what the
syringe contained but police said that the woman, in her 40s, was
not harmed.''

The Daily Telegraph (14th November 1996)

3.3.2 An interview with Brian Liddle (Chairman of the Western Isles Health
  Board)

Ospadal Nan Eileen is the only major hospital in the Western Isles.
They facility has to cater for a Population of 15,000. The facilities
include the only Maternity, Surgery and Emergency facilities on the
Island.

What security measures do you have in place?

``At present the hospital has closed circuit television cameras at
twelve major points in the hospital. These are mainly at the significant
entrances and exits. The pictures from the cameras are stored on to
a twelve hour video, which is changed at the end of each receptionists
shift. The tape is kept for one week and then re-used.''

How do you control access throughout the hospital?

``The only locked wards we have are psychiatric and maternity. Maternity
has a locked entrance, in which visitors request access by ringing
a door bell. Any sensitive areas of the hospital are accessed by a
pin number.''

Are you governed by legislation in this area?

``We have policies covering the safety of doctors, nurses and patients.''

Would being able to control access be useful in a hospital environment?

``I think in the near-future there will be some control of the movement
of personnel and visitors but I don't think at this moment in time
there is a 100% reliable system for achieving this.

3.4 Conclusion

Our groups' decision is to specifically target the area of school and
maternity ward security. The case of the Murrah building highlights
the increasing needs for public buildings to examine security. 

Building planners, architects, and managers must consider security
in the early stages of design; foresight can mean significant rewards.
Making a building secure does more than protect occupants and the
contents of buildings.

The Health and Safety at Work Regulations (1974) and as amended (1992)
requires 

``That every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment
of the risks to the health and safety of persons in his employment
arising out of or in connection with the conduct by him or his undertaking. ``

Employers now have a legal obligation to ensure the security of their
staff.


Over all, regardless of the purpose or size of a building, a security
system can serve to restrict access to controlled areas; prevent incidents;
monitor/record activity to facilitate intervention and investigation
if a security breach occurs; cut personnel costs, and raise morale
and productivity. Equally, an effective security can reduce an owner's
liability for damage. Courts have held building owners or managers
liable for assaults and other criminal acts committed on their properties.
Evidence of a security system design to prevent such acts can mitigate
the damages awarded by proving that reasonable care was taken to prevent
such occurrences.

By considering the needs of building occupants and visitors for easy
access, the desire to display or not display security aspects, and
by applying building codes and regulations, planners can design a
security system which meets but need not exceed standards. A graduated
scale of protection ensures that security can be cost effective. 

4 The Product

4.1 The Unit 

The door-entry system is designed to offer the following features:

* high level of reliability

* failsafe mechanisms in the event of vandalism or power failure

* simple user interface

* voice communication in two directions

* video communication in one direction

This has been facilitated by the use of various technologies. The failsafe
mechanisms are provided by the use of a mechanical and electro-mechanical
combination of lock mechanisms. In normal operation, the electro-mechanical
door mechanism operates to unlock the door, while a Yale-type latched
doorlock allows manual operation with a conventional key. This means
in the event of system failure due to power supply interruption, access
can still be gained to the property by use of a key. Normally this
key would be held by only one or two people, such as the security
staff, and should not be distributed for widespread use; as this would
defeat the security features inherent in the electronic mechanism. 

The main electro-mechanical mechanism is driven by lock control unit,
which in turn is connected by a serial link of variable length to
the remote PC. The lock control unit has the capability to automatically
control entry without needing to communicate with the remote PC, and
is therefore protected from failure in the event of a break in the
serial link. 

A simple user interface has been designed, which offers a high degree
of reliability and security. Although magnetic swipe cards are a widely-used
and low-cost technology in door-lock systems, this design does not
use them. There is another system which offers greater reliability
and convenience, while still being relatively low-cost for small to
moderate-sized markets. This technology is called iButton and it is
manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor; it consists of a small button-shaped
tag which can be mounted on a laminated identity card or a plastic
keyring holder. This means it is more convenient to carry around than
a conventional magnetic swipe card. 

Additionally, it does not require moving contact for it to be read,
and cannot be wiped by magnetic fields; this technology was therefore
chosen to meet the needs of our chosen market. Each iButton is manufactured
with a unique identification number, which our system reads from the
device and uses to identify the user. The user is then required to
enter a Personal Identification Number (PIN) which then allows them
to enter the building. The PIN is entered using a conventional numeric
keypad, which is part of the lock control system. 

The second mode of operation requires the use of video and audio systems.
The design requirement of using a serial link means that this data
has to be digitised and sent over the link. These functions are also
carried out by the lock control unit. It is proposed that the final
product would have the entry buzzer button located just below the
camera, so that the picture from the camera would be of the visitor's
face. The location of the microphone and speaker of the audio system
are less important, but these would be part of the same external unit,
and would be separate from the lock control unit itself.

Finally, the design is such that external tampering does not make access
possible. The input devices (camera, keypad, iButton reader, microphone)
and output devices (speaker, status indicators) are wired so that
they cannot cause the electro-mechanical door latch mechanism to activate.
As a backup to this, the door position sensor will detect if the door
has been opened without the electronic authorisation being issued.
If this happens, an alarm will sound in the lock control unit and
at the PC; this can be overridden from the PC side.

4.2 The door-lock unit hardware

4.2.1 Specific hardware devices 

The door entry system consists of several functional hardware components.
These components provide the interface to the person who is requesting
access to the property. Our hardware interface carries out the following
input and output functions:

* keypad data input (including the doorbell function)

* iButton serial number input 

* intercom audio input 

* door position detector input 

* video camera picture input 

* intercom audio output 

* door lock control signal output 

* visual status output (door open, system ready, access denied) 

The hardware component of the prototype system is based around a Motorola
68040 prototyping board (IDP), to which we have connected a Connectix
Quickcam. In order to provide the remaining functions we have added
an interface board, which incorporates the keypad, the intercom functions,
the door position detector, the iButton interface, the visual status
outputs, and the door lock control. 

4.3 The software

The software is composed of four components running on two platforms:
a daemon and GUI running on the client, and a program loader and general
control software running on the board (the Motorola IDP). Many support
routines are used, some common to both platforms; these are divided
into modules:

* Serial providing the communication subsystem; this operates in parallel
  with the rest of the software, using interrupts or signals;

* Low-level providing functions to access the hardware on the Motorola
  IDP board and the secondary board;

* Video grabs, compresses and decompresses frames;

* Audio samples, compresses, decompresses and plays back audio;

* Control handles the database and configuration information, and sends
  orders to various sections.

4.4 The Linux software

4.4.1 The daemon

The daemon runs continuously as long as the PC is switched on. It acts
as an intermediary between the Motorola board and the user interface;
it also provides vital functions to the Motorola board to allow the
latter to download its software and the user interface for automatic
operation without the user interface being loaded.

Communication with the Motorola board uses the serial subsystem; data
transfers with the user interface go through the System V IPC shared
memory mechanism([footnote] Note that System V IPC must therefore
be compiled in the Linux kernel.) . A user signal (SIGUSR1) can be sent
by either the daemon or the GUI to indicate that data needs to be
transferred.

During normal operation, the daemon stores the last frame taken at
any given time; audio is never transferred without the GUI. When the
board indicates the doorbell has been rung, the daemon activates the
GUI, starting it up if necessary, unless the user has indicated they
wish to use the PC without being bothered by the door-entry software.

4.4.2 The user interface

The user interface runs on a Linux PC running the X Windows user interface,
and had been predominantly constructed using the GTK+ toolkit in the
C programming language. It is contained in a binary file together
with all other non-continuous modules such as video and audio. The
UI is launched by the daemon on receiving a message from the Motorola
board.([fig] \resizebox*{0.5\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{gui_grab.ps}} \label{screenshot1}Screenshot
of prototype GUI) 

The main window is shown in fig \ref{screenshot1}, page \pageref{screenshot1}.
If this window is minimised it will be activated whenever someone
comes to the door. Normally the video frames will be updated approximately
once every second and there will be no audio. When someone presses
the buzzer and the PC user reacts, two way sound transmission will
begin and continue until a (long) timeout expires, or the person is
accepted or rejected. The functions of the various buttons are as
follows:

* Recapture --- pressing this button transmits a request to the Motorola
  board to recapture a frame of video. 

* Unlock --- the door unlocks. 

* Refuse --- this denies entry, someone who has passed all the other
  security mechanisms can still be refused entry if the user wishes

* Audio --- this loads an audio configuration program (mixer);

* Config --- this opens the system configuration panel;

* Close --- this closes the interface window;

* Do not disturb (not present in the screenshot) --- this minimises
  the interface window and tells the daemon not to pop it up.

5 Case Study: A school

5.1 Survey of local schools

There are approximately six hundred schools in the Edinburgh area.
We contacted seven of them to get information about whether they would
be interested in the system and to listen to any comments they had.
Some of the comments included.

``We would prefer the system to only have video on the main entrance
to the school, and would be worried that the school could become intimidating
to pupils.''

(Our Lady of Lourdes RC Primary School)

``Unless the government makes it a priority, then they would not be
taking any particular school precautions. The Cullen reports success
in banning handguns has allayed a lot of parents fears.''

(North Queensferry Primary School)

``There would need to be strict tests on the system to make sure it
did not infringe pupil safety. Although we do consider the project
a worthwhile exercise'' 

(Galashiels Academy)

Overall three of the schools contacted said that they would be interested
in a system for security, whilst four declared no interest for the
time being. If this survey is accurate then the market potential for
the Edinburgh area would be around 240 schools.

5.2 The System

Each entry point to the school either have the full unit, or a unit
with no camera. The main entrance to the school will be covered by
the full unit. All holders of the key will be able to enter through
any control point. All visitors will only be allowed to enter through
the main entrance. Visitors will have to ring the buzzer to request
entry. Communication can then take place to determine the visitors
identity. Dallas rings would be given `to all the users of the school
and anyone else who is designated as needing one. This can include
Councils so that parts of the school can be rented out and used by
community groups (the scouts or sports clubs etc) holders of the mechanical
key should include all three emergency services and a small number
of the senior staff. 

5.3 The Users

The authorized users of the system will be the the staff and the pupils.
The staff will comprise of teachers, janitors, cleaners etc. Each
user group will have different demands on the times they will need
to use the system.

* Teachers will need access at any time.

* Cleaners may not start until the end of the school day.

* Pupils should not be able to gain access outside school time. 

* Visitors should only be able to enter through designated control
  points.

The system will be configurable, so that each user group can be given
different access rights. 

5.4 The System Manager 

The system manager will have a system that is able to meet each users
groups need. They will be able to make changes to the database to
control access times and security levels. Pupils in year one of a
primary school can not be expected to remember long pin numbers or
complicated routines. Therefore the first few years in a primary school
may have no PIN or a smaller PIN than later years. The response from
schools was to not have PIN numbers at all for pupils access but we
should leave the option open.

The system manager should be the only one able to access the main computer.
This can be accomplished by utilizing existing iButton technology.
Information could be transferred between the iButton and a PC with
a momentary contact using a Blue Dot receptor. The Blue Dot sticks
to any convenient spot on the front of a PC and is cabled to the serial
or parallel port in the back. The information downloaded would be
a unique password to access the database. If the system manager is
the only one with the ring, he will be the only one who can access
the database.

5.5 SSERC questions`

How the system will react to the specific points mentioned in the interview
with Angus Morrison.

How does the system react if there is a fire alarm? 

``In the event of a fire the schools routine will not be affected by
the sytem. Each door can be manually opened from the inside to aid
escape.'' 

How do you know when the system has stopped working? 

``When then the system stops working then the school will be unaffected
as the back up of a mechanical lock will allow the school to have
the same security level as at present.'' 

Can a pupil claim to be late because their Dallas ring failed to open
the door? 

``By making the system durable (the Dallas rings have a life of around
ten years) pupils will not be able to get away with excuses.'' 

Does each door in the site have the system, and if they do, do they
all come with video cameras and are they all connected to the one
PC? 

``Each door will require at least a reader but the system would be
configurable to any desired options.'' 

Most importantly, will this system still work for you in ten years?
In twenty years?''

``The system ideally should last as long as it is needed, if it is
looked after correctly.''

6 Case Study: A Hospital

6.1 A survey of local hospitals

There are approximately forty four hospitals in the Edinburgh area,
we contacted four of them to gauge their reaction to the system. In
each case we talked to someone in charge of their works department.
Three of the four declared an interest in the product and their comments
included:`

``Although the system would be successful in wards, it does seem as
if it could be of more use in its automated format. We have specific
areas of the hospital that only certain people can enter, this includes
the morgue, pharmacy and computer departments. At present we use PIN
numbers and keys to gain access but this sounds like a more effective
way of implementing our security strategy ''

(Royal Victoria Hospital)

``Any form of access contol to wards would have to be rigorously monitored
to ensure patient safety is not infringed''

(Tippethill Hospital)

``If the system is reasonably cost effective then I can see it being
of interest to a lot of hospitals''

(Queen Margaret Hospital)

6.2 The System

The unit will be placed at the entrance to each ward. All holders of
the key will be able to enter through the control point. All visitors
will only be allowed to enter by pressing the buzzer to request entry.
Communication can then take place to determine the visitors identity.
Dallas rings would be given to all the staff who are deemed to need
one.

The second use would be the automated entry to points of security.
Only the people who require access to these areas (pharmacy etc) could
be given access to them and the database of the computer should be
configurable so that information about peoples access rights could
be kept on record. Ideally each user will only need one Dallas ring
to meet all their security needs. They will come to work; unlock their
door using their Dallas ring

\resizebox*{7cm}{5cm}{\includegraphics{../web/images/door3.ps}} 

Access their computer using a Blue Dot receptor. The technology will
reduce the need to have different security methods for different situations.
There will be no need to remember all your keys, PINs and passwords,
one technology will cover everything. Getting new security rights
will just be a matter of updating the computer database, no need for
waiting for a new key and no need to come up with new passwords.

6.3 The Users

The authorized users of the system will be the staff. The staff will
comprise of doctors, nurses and porters etc. Each user group will
have different demands on the times they will need to use the system.

* Doctors will need instant access to wards, a delay in a call out
  for a cardiac arrest could mean the difference between life and
  death.

* Nurses would also require ease of access but may not need access
  to specific areas of the hospital.

* Visitors should be controlled from entering wards outside of visiting
  hours, but during visiting hours there will probably need to have
  unlimited access to patients.

The system will be configurable, so that each user group can be given
different access rights. 

6.4 The System Manager 

The system manager will have a system that is able to meet each users
groups need. They will be able to make changes to the database to
control access times and security levels. Doctors should not need
to learn PIN numbers but should be able to gain access to areas with
just their Dallas ring. The response from hospitals was to not have
PIN numbers at all to simplify matters, but again we should leave
the option open.

The system manager should be the only one able to access the main computer.
This can be accomplished by utilizing existing iButton technology.
Information could be transferred between the iButton and a PC with
a momentary contact. Pressing the iButton to the Blue Dot Receptor,
a $15 (street price) "pipeline" into the PC. The Blue Dot sticks to
any convenient spot on the front of a PC and is cabled to the serial
or parallel port in the back. The information downloaded would be
a unique password to access the database. If the system manager is
the only one with the ring, he will be the only one who can access
the database.

6.4.1 An interview with John Fitzpatrick (consultant anaethetist at the
  Southern General.)

Are you governed by any specific security measures?

``I have a security pass to identify myself, I have a password to access
computer systems, a key for my office and PIN and key number to access
some chemical cupboards.''

Would you benefit from having one device that could replace all of
these?

``I think anything that made life easier would be a good thing but
it would need to be as secure as present technology''

7 Competitors

There are a great number of companies working in the field of security
systems. Most selling products that are scalable; if you want access
control you buy one part, if you need video as well then you add on
an another component. A minority of companies have designed specialized
systems for residential or small business' and only one or two have
decided to target a specific market.

7.1 School Security

7.1.1 ECr Concepts

ECr Concepts in Merthyr Tydfil plan to introduce a new credit-card
style pass system to primary and secondary schools. It will monitor
on computer everything from attendance to what children eat for lunch.
Parents can pay for school meals in advance and this will be recorded
on a computer. When a child goes for a meal, the card is swiped and
a picture of the youngster appears on the computer for identification.
The order is also recorded.

Parents can ask for a weekly read-out of meals eaten and obtain a breakdown
of their fat, carbohydrate and protein content to ensure a healthy,
balanced diet. The card will incorporate an entry function. It can
be used to enter the school and selected controlled areas. As well
as keeping out intruders, staff will be able to monitor attendance
and record daily movements in the school.

Their local councillor stated: 

``It sounds a great idea for the future of security and paying for
meals and other services in schools. The card will not only ensure
that unauthorized access is not allowed at school but can cover simple
everyday things like ensuring children have their school meals. I
can envisage a day in the not too distant future when every schoolchild
in Britain will have one of these cards to use in their schools."

7.2 Specialized Security Systems

7.2.1 CEM Security Systems

CEM security systems has a similar marketing strategy to our own. They
have seen a specific gap in the market (airport security) and designed
their product accordingly. 

Since installing their first system at Belfast International Airport
in 1987, CEM Systems Ltd. has migrated their Airport 2000 system throughout
the major airports of the United Kingdom including Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, Glasgow, Manchester, East Midlands, Luton and Edinburgh.
CEM have also installed similar systems in airports around the globe. 

Each different airport in the United Kingdom has differing security
needs. However, all use the Airport 2000 Visual Imaging Pass Production
System (VIPPS) in one manner or another. VIPPS captures, compresses,
stores and retrieves graphical and textual data such as images, logos
and signatures. 

Their chairman states:

"VIPPS allows the airport to add graphical and textual information
to the database, capture images from live or still cameras and photographs,
retrieve and update previously entered data, write data to various
card technologies and define badge layouts."

7.3 Security using iButton technology

7.3.1 Seadan Security & Electronics

Seadan Security & Electronics offers the EL1200 Access System for physical
access control of medium-size offices and buildings, or areas within
buildings. The EL1200 system can store information for up to 1,500
individuals permitted to access a building. 

To gain entrance to a building secured with the EL1200 Access System,
an employee touches his or her iButton-based key ring or token to
an iButton reader mounted by the door, then enters their Personal
Identification Number (PIN). The system compares the data read from
the iButton and PIN number to the system's data base, then unlocks
the door if the data is verified as correct. An entry log is maintained
by the EL1200 showing all persons who entered by a specific door,
and what date and time they entered. 

The system allows for 10 access time zones or categories, allowing
the system to compensate for a company's holiday schedule. The iButton
reader unit has 12 keys and 4 display characters for simple operation
and programming. Output point can be configured as a door open alarm
output, timer-driven output, or sensor alarm output Standard software
packages are available 

The EL1200 is equipped with a standard interface for network operation.
Ultimately connecting the units to a PC for centralized monitoring
and control. 

7.3.2 Cansec Systems Ltd. 

Cansec offers two iButton access readers for use with Cansec- and OEM-manufactured
access control systems, and the associated TAS100 Data Management
Software package supports up to 1,000 users and four reader groups
for either the TAS100 or the RT100. 

TAS100 Touch Access Stand-Alone System is a self-contained, programmable
access control system. It is simple to install and operate, requiring
no communications wires for use. The system includes easy-to-use programming
software, and access keys are programmed with a read/write iButton
key. The reader features rugged metal construction and bi-color LED
status. A Sonalert tone alerts users to someone attempting or achieving
access to a building or room. . A bi-colored LED and Sonalert provide
users with both visual and audible signals of access being granted
or denied. The face plate and stainless steel read head are vandal-resistant
and suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. While in use, the last
64 access granted messages can be retrieved from the Reader with an
audit key.

7.4 General Security Companies

7.4.1 Gyr secutity 

Gyr market an advanced security management system specifically designed
to assist professional facilities and security managers by providing
a single screen solution. It's claimed to be the ideal tool for building
access, parking access and CCTV control at single or multiple locations.

7.4.2 PAC access control

PAC for Windows Residential is a PC based housing security system running
under Microsoft Windows. The system has been designed for single and
multi-block estates with up to 30,640 doors and any number of users.

PAC for Windows Residential offers a wide range of building management
functions which include: monitoring and controlling security cameras;
linking to paging systems for mobile personnel and monitoring fire
doors and lift doors to check wether they have been left open.

Tenants are issued with PAC proximity keys, three per flat, color coded
for easy recognition. Local authority staff carry PAC proximity ID
cards which include a photograph for identification purpose

At the Housing Office, PAC readers are fitted to external doors, to
restrict access to the building, and system administration is carried
out at a central PC. Additional PCs are located in the concierge of
each of the residential blocks for monitoring alarms and system events,
and to allow guards manual control of doors and carpark barriers.

Ancillary equipment, including panic buttons, fire exits, ventilation
and heating equipment in the main building are monitored using PAC
Alarm Event Managers. Concierge and maintenance staff are alerted
to problems via pagers.

Car park lighting is time-controlled via the PAC Alarm Event Manager.

Elevator control is used in each of the residential blocks to restrict
access by tenants to different floors of the main building.

7.5 Conclusion

There are only a couple of companies working in the field of iButton
building access control, none of which have identified a niche market
or offer audio visual communication. 

Our Group is unique in that it is supplying a state of the art system
that will meet the needs of our market. Like Cemsys we have identified
a specific need and therefore we should be able to reap the dividend.

8 Appendix

8.1 Serial ID Button

What is an iButton? 

\includegraphics{../web/images/ibutton.ps} 

The iButton is a 16mm computer chip housed in a stainless steel can.
The iButton can be worn by a person or attached to an object for up-to-date
information at the point of use.The steel button is rugged enough
to withstand harsh outdoor environments; it is durable enough for
a person to wear everyday on a digital accessory like a ring, key
fob, wallet, watch, or badge.

\includegraphics{../web/images/overvw3.ps} 

There are a variety of buttons with different features. Each starts
with a guaranteed-unique registration number engraved in the silicon.
Some buttons add computer memory to store typed text or digitized
photos; information can be updated as often as needed with a simple,
momentary contact. Other buttons contain a real-time clock to track
the number of hours a system is turned on for maintenance and warranty
purposes; a temperature sensor for applications where spoilage is
a concern, such as food transport; a transaction counter that allows
the button to be used as a small change purse; or complete cryptographic
circuitry to secure Internet transactions.  

The fragile silicon chip within the iButton is protected by stainless
steel. You can drop it, step on it, scratch it, or wear it swimming.
iButtons have a useful life of around 10 years while a magnetic /
barcode system 's useful life is only 3 months to 2 years depends
on the usage and maintenance. The ibutton has a unique Read Only Serial
Number, no one can copy your ibutton or master ibutton.

Authorization Buttons are sophisticated microelectronics, sealed into
miniature stainless steel cans, creating a low cost, portable medium
for storing and controlling access to sensitive information

The iButton is ideal for any application where information needs to
travel with a person or object. An iButton can grant its owner access
to a building, a PC, a piece of equipment, or a vehicle. Attached
to a work tote, it can measure a variety of processes to improve efficiency,
such as manufacturing, delivery, and maintenance. Some versions of
the iButton can be used to store cash for small transactions, such
as transit systems, parking lots, and vending machines. The iButton
can also be used as an electronic asset tag to store information needed
to keep track of valuable capital equipment. 

Users of the iButtons include the U.S. Post Office, which has iButtons
affixed to blue corner mailboxes nationwide so they can do the tracking
needed to ensure on-time delivery of the mail. Ryder has its entire
truck fleet fitted with iButtons that track vehicle maintenance. Citizens
of Istanbul, Turkey store digital cash in the iButton, using the device
as a small change purse on their mass transit system. 

iButton technology works well in commercial applications where multiple
users and continuous use put stress on less robust electronic devices.
In hotels, for instance, children cannot stick paper into the iButtons
door receptors, and the iButton never jams in a lock. The usage instructions
are superbly simple and quickly demonstrable: just press the button
to the receptor. Besides being durable, reliable and easy to use,
iButton technology also wins management approval because it consumes
virtually zero power. In large facilities such as hospital, office,
and apartment buildings, low maintenance and power consumption are
factors that register on the black side of the ledger. 

In conclusion, the architecture is very elegant, can migrate into the
mainstream PC market with little engineering effort, and offers opportunity
for the emergence of distributed security solutions that are both
cost effective and reliable. 

8.2 Blue Dot Receptor 

\includegraphics{../web/images/blue.ps} 

The DS1402 Blue Dot Receptor is used to make iButton access convenient.
The cable is connected to either the DS1410E or DS1411. The Blue Dot
can be mounted anywhere in the desktop area that is convenient. 

Communication between the iButton and the host is accomplished by simply
pressing the iButton to the Blue Dot. One method is to touch the iButton
to the Blue Dot momentarily. If the iButton is pushed further into
the Blue Dot, it will snap in and dwell, allowing hands-free operation. 

Two Blue Dots are provided to accommodate instances where multiple
iButtons are required to complete a transaction. For example, a company's
policy may be to require both an employee and a supervisor to authenticate
access to sensitive information stored on a network server. Operation
modes can also be interchanged arbitrarily (i.e., the employee's iButton
may be required to dwell and the supervisor's iButton need only make
momentary contact).
