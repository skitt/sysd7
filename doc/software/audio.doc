Audio Compression
The Audio compression system will be based around ADPCM compression which will
take the audio down to a 2bits/sample, 8kHz sampling rate which gives a data rate of 16,000bps.  This is reduced from the 8,000x8=64,000bps rate of the raw sample data.

Format of data from PC.
On the Linux(client) side, the system will be implemented via the Open Sound System(OSS) which is part of the linux kernel.  This will produce an unsigned, 8-bit sample (0-255) at 8kHz.  This will be converted to a signed 8-bit sample (-128-127), and then bit-shifted into the 14-bit word for the ADPCM encoder to work on.

Compression standard.
The ADPCM system is as defined in the CCITT G.726 16kbps audio compression standard.
G.726 specs are available from ITU's gopher and www site : http://www.itu.ch
The code is taken from SUN's implementation which has been released into the public domain.

Compression format.
The ADPCM encoder will then take the 14-bit word and produce a 2-bit code that will be buffered into a byte with 3 other codes before being transmitted as part of a 510-byte packet representing roughly 1/4 of a second of sound.
The client will also take 510-byte packets, decode them then convert the resultant 14-bit sample back to unsigned 8-bit, and then play it.
