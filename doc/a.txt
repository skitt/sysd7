1 Introduction

Ding Dong Doorentry Systems Ltd has commissioned our group to develop
an idea for a new product. Their business has so far been based on
selling simple but supposedly vandal-proof door entry systems for
stair doors. Their new idea involves branching out into high - specification
door- entry systems, and in particular, taking advantage of the fact
that most small companies and may homes now have a PC inside them.
Since PC's already incorporate a screen and sound facilities, the
intention is to sell a door-entry system that allows a person within
the premises to use a PC to view the person at the door which interfaces
to the PC via a serial port. This unit would be sold together with
the necessary PC software .

Since all PC's have serial ports, Ding Dong's idea is to produce a
unit to be sited by the door which interfaces to the PC via a serial
port. This unit would be sold together with the necessary PC software.

Ding Dong would also like to offer the facility of having the PC contol
control entry automatically (ie without a person being present at
the PC) and suggest this could be done by operating the door with
a combination of some kind of personal card or key, and a PIN number.

We have been commissioned to produce, rapidly and inexpensively a demonstration
prototype. We have have to refine its vague specification for the
product , decide on the best way to provide the facilities that Ding
Dong wants to see, and to develop additional features that might increase
the product's marketability.

2 Market Research

The design specification identified two markets for the product. We
carried out a survey to gauge the degree of practicality and interest
in producing a product for these markets. The results are separated
into Residential and Commercial Properties

2.1 Residential Properties

We carried out an informal survey of 127 residents in and around Marchmont.
The accommodation in this area mostly comprises of flats. The majority
of people living in this area are between 20-35 years old. They were
al ltold the idea of the product before the questions were asked.
Anybody who answered no to any question, was excluded from the rest
of the survey.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                             Residential                              | YES | NO |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                 Do you have a PC in you Household?                   | 42  | 85 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|             Do you have some form of door entry system?              | 35  | 7  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|Would you be interested in combining the PC with a door entry system? |  6  | 29 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+


Our survey indicates that only 17% of the people who had a PC and a
door entry system would be interested in a product that combined the
two. Although the market demand currently is low; the demand in future
may rise. We identified the main residential markets to assess their
likely future demands.

2.1.1 Blocks of Flats 

The increase of PC's in the home may allow this product to become an
alternative to the standard door-entry system. According to a representative
of Castle Security (a local security company) the system would face
the problem of convincing sections of the population of its value.
Their will always be a percentage who will be resistant to new technology,
and a section who will resist having to pay for a new technology. 

2.1.2 Accommodation with a servitor

The servitors office would contain the PC and during the day people
could be let in by visual identification only. During the night a
form of security could be set for the main entrances. The potential
here is for accommodation similar to halls of residence. 

A spokesmen for Pollock halls of residence was enthusiastic about the
system, the individual halls all have offices next to the only entrance,
all the offices also contain PC's that are unused overnight. The system
would be beneficial in enabling only residents to enter their building
after the site has been locked. The also suggested an application
for the front gate of the halls were they use visual identification
to let cars in. It would be cheaper to run the system automatically
than to hire doormen.

2.1.3 Semi / Detached Property

Presently these properties have little or no door entry system; convincing
them to purchase an audio/visual system would mean convining them
that they need some form of access control. 

The biggest market in this area would be properties sited within large
grounds ie. estate houses, which can have entrances that are set a
significant distance away from the property. These properties could
use the improved security of visual communication. 

2.1.4 Conclusion

Examining th residential user group, their needs and their response
to our proposed design it is clear that although there is enthusiasm
from some parts of the market, Pollock halls, most others currently
have no need or desire to own this product. The majority of people
are quite happy with their present system.

2.2 Commercial

We carried out an informal survey of fourteen small to medium size
commercial properties.. The business' comprised of a lawyers firm
to a Dental surgery. They were all explained the initial design specification
before the questions were asked. Anybody who answered no to any question,
was excluded from the rest of the survey.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                             Commercial                               | YES | NO |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|                   Does your office contain a PC?                     | 15  | 0  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|             Do you have some form of door entry system?              | 14  | 1  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+
|Would you be interested in combining the PC with a door entry system? |  8  | 6  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----+----+


Our survey indicates that 57% of the companies who had a PC and a door
entry system would be interested in a product that combined the two.
Specific commercial targets were then identified so that we could
determine a business strategy.

2.2.1 Education

Enabling schools to place this system at their entry points would allow
them to limit unauthorized visitor movement. Allowing the children
and the teachers to have their own entry device would allow them to
have authorized access to the school. Anyone else would require to
identify themselves using the audio/visual communication. Outside
of school times the site would be closed to all but those with security
access. 

2.2.2 NHS 

The system would be integrated to the front doors of wards that demand
security eg maternity wards. Visitors would only be able to enter
these areas if they have a specific reason to be there. The problem
with existing NHS security include

* security being lax because no-one monitors the video cameras.

* security is bypassed by people who pretend to be some one else

The system would have to be reliable and easy to use as there may be
emergency situations when time is critical,specifically a cardiac
arrest alert needs a Doctor to get to the patient as soon a possible.
Therefore the system will involve Doctors needing instant access to
wards, whilst there is still a level of security that will satisfy
parents.

2.2.3 Small/large business

The system would work as stated in the design specification.

2.2.4 Conclusion

Examining the commercial user group, their needs and their response
to our proposed design it is clear that there is enthusiasm from the
majority of this market. Our decision will be wether to design the
product for a general Commercial group or wether we should concentrate
on a specific user group.

3 Product Strategy

Three points influenced our decision to aim the product at a specific
niche market.

3.1 Government Legislation 

In the wake of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma
City, the Justice Department reviewed security at federal facilities
around the country. The review resulted in some 8,500 countermeasures
now being implemented by the General Services Administration (GSA).
A significant number of which concern visitor access to sites.

3.2 Worries About School Security

In light of the Cullen Inquiry into the Dunblane report Lord Cullen
stated

It is recognized that there should be arrangements for security to
prevent unauthorized access to the school.

The national union of teachers stated that 

EVERY school in Britain should be redesigned so that they have only
one entrance 

Which was first recommended by Lord Elton in his 1989 inquiry into
school security. The Manchester branch called for 

legislation which will ensure that each school invests in adequate
and appropriate safety and surveillance systems to protect staff and
deter intruders.

3.2.1 Case Study

Several schools have suffered devastating arson attacks. Millions have
had to be spent on refurbishment or rebuilding, simply because arsonists
could walk on to school premises at will.

Then there is theft. It is quite common for thieves to wander into
school in search of easy pickings during the working day. One school
had people and property protected by a security guard with an Alsatian
during parents' evenings.

The tragic deaths of Philip Lawrence, the head teacher who died protecting
a pupil, and of Nicky Conroy, the schoolgirl shot dead while quietly
at work in a school classroom, should have focused attention on the
problem of how to keep undesirable away from schools. 

One week prior to the government report into school security. The deranged
Thomas Hamilton ran amok and killed 16 infants and a teacher at Dunblane
in March 1996.

The Times (Friday, 24 May 1996)

3.2.2 Interview with Mr N McLeod (Assistant Head Teacher of Stornoway Primary
  School)

Stornoway Primary has a roll of approximately 420. All the classes
are contained in one complex, and the site is self contained. There
are seven entrences, one for each year of the school, and two main
entrences for visitors and teachers etc.

Is There any problem with security at the school?

``The main problem we have is the rise of vandalism at the weekends,
the breaking of school windows and the setting a light of dustbins,
costs the school approximately £10,000 per annum''

What measures does the school have In tackling security issues?

``During the day the school is open to anyone; at night the entrances
are all locked and the police make regular patrols to discourage the
vandals. By the autumn the school will be connected up to Stornoway's
CCTV system.''

Does the school have a budget for security?

``No, we use part of our building allowance to pay for any security
needs. In the past this has meant buying better security for the windows
on the ground floor.''

Is there more Pressure on schools in light of the Dunblane Incident?

``In the immediate aftermath, there was a degree of anxiety from parents,
I think it has made the more aware that schools can find it hard to
properly look after every individual pupil.''

3.3 Maternity Wards

Over recent years a number of baby's have been snatched from hospitals

A BABY girl was snatched from her cot in a hospital maternity unit
yesterday three hours after being born, in front of her drowsing mother
who lay in an adjacent bed recovering from a Caesarian section.

Kali Hawthorne was grabbed by a blonde-haired woman who walked into
the ward as the baby's father was telephoning relatives from a nearby
corridor to tell them of the birth ... The abduction again raised
major questions about security in hospital maternity wards which was
supposed to have been increased following the abduction of four-hour-old
Abbie Humphreys from the Queen's Medical Center, Nottingham, in July
1994. 

The Daily Telegraph (6th Decembers 1997)

3.3.1 An interview with Brian Liddle(Chairman of the Western Isles Health
  Board)

Ospadal Nan Eileen is the only major hospital in the Western Isles.
They facility has to cater for a Population of 45,000. The facilities
include the only Maternity, Surgery and Emergency facilities on the
Island.

What security Measures do you have in place?

``At present the hospital has closed circuit television cameras a 12
major points in the hospital. These are mainly at the significant
entrances and exits, as well as covering some wards. The pictures
from the cameras are stored on to long play video, which is changed
at the end of a receptionists shift. The tape is kept for one week
and then re-used.''

How do you contol access throughout the hospital?

``The only locked wards we have are psychiatric and maternity. Maternity
has a locked entrance with visitors requesting access by ringing a
door bell. Any sensitive areas of the hospital are accessed by a pin
number. Anybody who is in an area they should not be in will be asked
to leave by a nurse or a porter.''

Are you governed by legislation in this area?

``We have policies covering the safety of Doctors, Nurses and Patients.''

Would Access contol be useful in a Hospital Environment?

``I think in the near-future there will be some control of the movement
of personnel and visitors but I don't think at this moment in time
there is a 100% reliable system for achieving this.

3.4 Conclusion

Our Groups decision is to specifically target the area of school and
maternity ward security. The case of the Murrah building does highlight
the increasing needs for public buildings to examine security. 

Building planners, architects, and managers must consider security
in the early stages of design; foresight can mean significant rewards.
Making a building secure does more than protect occupants and the
contents of buildings.

The Health and Safety at Work Regulations(1974) and as amended (1992)
requires 

That every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment
of ... the risks to the health and safety of persons not in his employment
arising out of or in connection with the conduct by him or his undertaking. 

Employers now have a legal obligation to ensure the security of their
staff.


Over all, regardless of the purpose or size of a building, a security
system can serve to restrict access to controlled areas, prevent incidents,
and monitor/record activity to facilitate intervention and investigation
if a security breach occurs, cut personnel costs, and raise morale
and productivity. Equally, an effective security can reduce an owner's
liability for damage. Courts have held building owners or managers
liable for assaults and other criminal acts committed on their properties.
Evidence of a security system design to prevent such acts can mitigate
the damages awarded by proving that reasonable care was taken to prevent
such occurrences.

By considering the needs of building occupants and visitors for easy
access, the desire to display or not display security aspects, and
by applying building codes and regulations, planners can design a
security system which meets but need not exceed standards. A graduated
scale of protection ensures that security can be cost effective. 

4 An Overview

4.1 The Unit

The unit will be a high security, low cost access contol system. Each
entrance to the site will have an all in one unit comprising of:

* A Dallas ring reader

* Speaker

* Microphone

* Video camera

* Buzzer

This unit would be connected to the PC using ....

The unit will have two modes of operation

4.1.1 Manuel Operation

Access can be gained by placing a Dallas ring into the reader. The
door will then open if a correct keynumber is provided. If the correct
pin number is not forthcoming the the user will be timed out and will
have to replace their Dallas ring. If access is required and the visitor
does not have a Dallas Ring then they will be able to ring the buzzer
to talk to the operator. The operator will be able to view video pictures
streamed from the camera to gauge wether the visitor should gain access.
The user will be able to enable access to the site from their computer.

4.1.2 Automatic Operation

Access can be gained by placing a Dallas ring into the reader. The
door will then open if a correct key number is provided. If the correct
pin number is not forthcoming the the user will be timed out and will
have to replace their Dallas ring. If access is required and the visitor
does not have a Dallas Ring then they will not be able to gain entry.

4.2 Case Study1

4.2.1 The System

All entrances to the school will be covered by the unit, 

4.2.2 The Users

The holders of the Dallas ring will be the teachers and the pupils.
This will enable them to have access throughout the school day.

The system will be configurable so that access time for pupils and
teachers can vary eg pupils will not need to be able to gain access
to the school at the weekend or in the holidays. Teachers may need
to work late or gain access during breaks. 

4.2.3 The System Manager 

The manager should have contol over who should be able to gain access
to the site. They will also need to have contol over the data held
in the Database. If the computer is an a receptionists office then
they should also be able to continue using the normal features over
their computer whilst nobody is requesting access.

4.3 casestudy2

4.3.1 The system

The system would be placed at any entry point in the hospital that
requires access control security. 

4.3.2 The users

The main system requirement would be reliability. The Access could
not be impared at 

5 The Product

The system is based on state of the art ibutton technology. 

5.1 Serial ID Button

What is an ibutton? 

\includegraphics{../web/images/ibutton.ps} 

The ibutton is a 16mm computer chip housed in a stainless steel can.
The iButton can be worn by a person or attached to an object for up-to-date
information at the point of use.The steel button is rugged enough
to withstand harsh outdoor environments; it is durable enough for
a person to wear everyday on a digital accessory like a ring, key
fob, wallet, watch, or badge.

\includegraphics{../web/images/overvw3.ps} 

There are a variety of buttons with different features. Each starts
with a guaranteed-unique registration number engraved in the silicon.
Some buttons add computer memory to store typed text or digitized
photos; information can be updated as often as needed with a simple,
momentary contact. Other buttons contain a real-time clock to track
the number of hours a system is turned on for maintenance and warranty
purposes; a temperature sensor for applications where spoilage is
a concern, such as food transport; a transaction counter that allows
the button to be used as a small change purse; or complete cryptographic
circuitry to secure Internet transactions.  

The fragile silicon chip within the iButton is protected by the ultimate
durable material: stainless steel. You can drop it, step on it, scratch
it, or wear it swimming. IButtons' have a useful life of around 10
years while a magnetic / barcode system 's useful life is only 3 months
to 2 years depends on the usage and maintenance. The ibutton has a
unique Read Only Serial Number, no one can copy your ibutton or master
ibutton.

Authorization Buttons are sophisticated microelectronics, sealed into
miniature stainless steel cans, creating a low cost, portable medium
for storing and controlling access to sensitive information

The iButton is ideal for any application where information needs to
travel with a person or object. Affixed to a badge, key fob, watch,
or ring, an iButton can grant its owner access to a building, a PC,
a piece of equipment, or a vehicle. Attached to a work tote, it can
measure a variety of processes to improve efficiency, such as manufacturing,
delivery, and maintenance. Some versions of the iButton can be used
to store cash for small transactions, such as transit systems, parking
lots, and vending machines. The iButton can also be used as an electronic
asset tag to store information needed to keep track of valuable capital
equipment. 

With 20 million iButton currently in circulation, the list of users
is very long. Some of the larger installations include the U.S. Post
Office, which has iButtons affixed to blue corner mailboxes nationwide
so they can do the tracking needed to ensure on-time delivery of the
mail. Ryder has its entire truck fleet fitted with iButtons that track
vehicle maintenance. Citizens of Istanbul, Turkey store digital cash
in the iButton, using the device as a small change purse on their
mass transit system. iButton Applications Worldwide highlights a variety
of iButton applications. 

In conclusion, the architecture is very elegant, can migrate into the
mainstream PC market with little engineering effort, and offers opportunity
for the emergence of distributed security solutions that are both
cost effective and reliable. 

6 Competitors

There are a great number of companies working in the field of Security
systems. Most selling products that are scalable; if you want Access
Control you buy one part, if you need video as well then you an on.
A minority of companies have designed specialised systems for Residential
or small busineess' and only one or two have decided to target a unique
market.

6.1 School Security

6.1.1 ECr Concepts

ECr Concepts in Merthyr Tydfil plan to introduce a new credit card-style
pass system to secondary and primary schools. It will monitor on computer
everything from attendance to what children eat for lunch. Parents
can pay for school meals in advance and this will be recorded on a
computer. When a child goes for a meal, the card is swiped and a picture
of the youngster appears on the computer for identification. What
is ordered is also recorded.

Parents can ask for a weekly read-out of meals eaten and obtain a breakdown
of their fat, carbohydrate and protein content to ensure a healthy,
balanced diet. The card will incorporate an entry function. It can
be used to enter the school and selected controlled areas. As well
as keeping out intruders, staff will be able to monitor attendance
and record daily movements in the school.

Their local councillor stated: 

"It sounds a great idea for the future of security and paying for meals
and other services in schools. The card will not only ensure that
unauthorized access is not allowed at school but can cover simple
everyday things like ensuring children have their school meals. I
can envisage a day in the not too distant future when every schoolchild
in Britain will have one of these cards to use in their schools."

6.2 Specialised Security Systems

6.2.1 CEM Security Systems

CEM security systems has a similar marketing strategy to our own. They
have seen a specific gap in the market (airport security) and designed
their product accordingly. 

Since installing their first system at Belfast International Airport
in 1987, CEM Systems Ltd. has migrated their Airport 2000 system throughout
the major airports of the United Kingdom including Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, Glasgow, Manchester, East Midlands, Luton and Edinburgh.
CEM have also installed similar systems in airports around the globe. 

Each different airport in the United Kingdom has differing security
needs. However, all use the Airport 2000 Visual Imaging Pass Production
System (VIPPS) in one manner or another. VIPPS captures, compresses,
stores and retrieves graphical and textual data such as images, logos
and signatures. 

Their chairman states:

"VIPPS allows the airport to add graphical and textual information
to the database, capture images from live or still cameras and photographs,
retrieve and update previously entered data, write data to various
card technologies and define badge layouts."

6.3 Security using iButton technology

6.3.1 Seadan Security & Electronics

Seadan Security & Electronics offers the EL1200 Access System for physical
access control of medium-size offices and buildings, or areas within
buildings. The EL1200 system can store information for up to 1,500
individuals permitted to access a building. 

To gain entrance to a building secured with the EL1200 Access System,
an employee touches his or her iButton-based key ring or token to
an iButton reader mounted by the door, then enters their Personal
Identification Number (PIN). The system compares the data read from
the iButton and PIN number to the system's data base, then unlocks
the door if the data is verified as correct. An entry log is maintained
by the EL1200 showing all persons who entered by a specific door,
and what date and time they entered. 

The system allows for 10 access time zones or categories, allowing
the system to compensate for a company's holiday schedule. The iButton
reader unit has 12 keys and 4 display characters for simple operation
and programming. Output point can be configured as a door open alarm
output, timer-driven output, or sensor alarm output Standard software
packages are available 

The EL1200 is equipped with a standard interface for network operation.
Ultimately connecting the units to a PC for centralized monitoring
and control. 

6.3.2 Cansec Systems Ltd. 

Cansec offers two iButton access readers for use with Cansec- and OEM-manufactured
access control systems, and the associated TAS100 Data Management
Software package supports up to 1,000 users and four reader groups
for either the TAS100 or the RT100. 

TAS100 Touch Access Stand-Alone System is a self-contained, programmable
access control system. It is simple to install and operate, requiring
no communications wires for use. The system includes easy-to-use programming
software, and access keys are programmed with a read/write iButton
key. The reader features rugged metal construction and bi-color LED
status. A Sonalert tone alerts users to someone attempting or achieving
access to a building or room. . A bi-colored LED and Sonalert provide
users with both visual and audible signals of access being granted
or denied. The face plate and stainless steel read head are vandal-resistant
and suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. While in use, the last
64 access granted messages can be retrieved from the Reader with an
audit key.

6.4 General Security Companies

6.4.1 Gyr secutity 

Gyr market an advanced security management system specifically designed
to assist professional facilities and security managers by providing
a single screen solution. It's claimed to be the ideal tool for building
access, parking access and CCTV control at single or multiple locations.

6.4.2 PAC access control

PAC for Windows Residential is a PC based housing security system running
under Microsoft Windows. The system has been designed for single and
multi-block estates with up to 30,640 doors and any number of users.

PAC for Windows Residential offers a wide range of building management
functions which include: monitoring and controlling security cameras;
linking to paging systems for mobile personnel and monitoring fire
doors and lift doors to check wether thy have been left open; 

Tenants are issued with PAC proximity keys, three per flat, color coded
for easy recognition. Local authority staff carry PAC proximity ID
cards which include a photograph for identification purpose

At the Housing Office, PAC readers are fitted to external doors, to
restrict access to the building, and system administration is carried
out at a central PC. Additional PCs are located in the concierge of
each of the residential blocks for monitoring alarms and system events,
and to allow guards manual control of doors and carpark barriers.

Ancillary equipment, including panic buttons, fire exits, ventilation
and heating equipment in the main building are monitored using PAC
Alarm Event Managers. Concierge and maintenance staff are alerted
to problems via pagers.

Car park lighting is time-controlled via the PAC Alarm Event Manager.

Elevator control is used in each of the residential blocks to restrict
access by tenants to different floors of the main building.

6.5 Conclusion

There are only a couple of companies working in the field of iButton
building access control, none of which have identified a niche market
or offer audio visual communication. 

Our Group is unique in that it is supplying a state of the art system
that will meet the needs of our market. Like Cemsys we have identified
a specific need and therefore we should be able to reap the dividend.
